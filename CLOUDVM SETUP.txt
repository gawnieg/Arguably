Vm created.

Request made to CSG - can now use ksu command and password
to get root access on VM from outside college network.

Want Node, npm, apache, neo4j.
Node is already installed by default on DOC machines.



INSTALL APACHE:
apt-get install apache2
START APACHE:
/etc/init.d/apache2 start	(can then go to vm's IP in browser (on college network) and see index.html)
				(default visible folder is /var/www/html)

TO MAKE HTML FOLDER ACCESIBLE FROM WINSCP
change owner from parent folder with: chown *USERNAME* html



ENABLE UNIVERSE REPOSITORY THING TO INSTALL NPM:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) universe

INSTALL NPM:
apt install npm


USE NODE MODULE FOREVER (CAN INSTALL WITH NPM) TO HAVE NODE SERVER RUN PERMANENTLY IN BACKGROUND:
forever start app.js
forever stop app.js
forever list		(to see what you're running - often old instances block ports)
(instead of node app.js)



INSTALL NEO4J:

wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.org/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo 'deb http://debian.neo4j.org/repo stable/' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
sudo apt-get update

(shouldn't need sudo's)

sudo apt-get install neo4j=3.1.1



SET NEO4J PASSWORD (can only do once when started up):
neo4j-admin set-initial-password <whatever>


RUNNING NEO4J DATABASE;
neo4j status
neo4j start
neo4j stop


TO MAKE NEO4J BROWSER ACCESSIBLE FROM OUTSIDE VM:
NEO4J CONFIG FILE LIVES AT:
/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf

UNCOMMENT THIS LINE:
dbms.connectors.default_listen_address_=0.0.0.0

THEN CAN ACCESS ON COLLEGE NETWORK BY TYPING (VM's IP):7474 IN ADDRESS BAR.








TO SEND STUFF FROM LAB MACHINES TO HTML FOLDER ON VM:
(YOU MUST HAVE WRITE PERMISSION TO WHATEVER DIRECTORY YOU SEND TO - USE CHMOD ON VM WITH ROOT ACCESS TO EDIT FOLDER PERMISSIONS)

scp fib.pl gdb16@146.169.45.149:/var/www/html
(FROM HOME USE WINSCP, MUCH NICER)
